# ReactWebsite

This is a demo website built using React, React-Animated-CSS and React-Animate-On-Scroll. The app has the potential to be expanded with React Router, Redux and ReduxSparklines, as highlighted in the relevant component sections.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
